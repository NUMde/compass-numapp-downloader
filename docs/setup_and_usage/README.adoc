== Setup and Usage

This documentatioon will provide you with information on how to setup the downloader script and how to use it.

=== Setup

==== Keys

Given the en-/decryption functions implemented by the downloader script, you need to store the required key files in the *keys* folder. The following files are required: 

* private.pem: Your private key which matches the public key that was used for encryption in the mobile app.
* cert.pem: Your certificate which matches the one that was used for encryption in the mobile app.
* public_sender.pem: The senders public key matching the private key that was used for signing in the mobile backend.

==== Configuration

Several configuration parameters must be set for the download script to run successfully. An example config file is given by _config.sample_. Rename this file to _config.py_ and add your corresponding values.

These are the configuration parameters which you must adapt:

* BASE_URL_DEV:     Api route for your development instance of the mobile backend
* BASE_URL:         Api route for your production instance of the mobile backend
* CLIENT_ID:        Identification of client for retrieval of authentication token
* CLIENT_SECRET:    Secret of client for retrieval of authentication token

Change the following parameters if you modified the backend routes or wish to define custom file paths:

* AUTH_TYPE:        Authentication type for requests to mobile backend
* DL_ROUTE:         Questionnaire response download route name
* AUTH_ROUTE:       Authentication route name
* INT_RESULT_PATH:  Path to file for logging of intermediate result (encrypted questionnaire response objects)
* RESULT_PATH:      Path to file for logging of final result (decrypted questionnaire response objects)
* PRIV_KEY:         Path  to private key file
* PUB_KEY_SENDER:   Path  to public key file
* CERT:             Path  to certificate file

IMPORTANT: Remember to adapt the Docker run command when you change the log output to a different directory!

=== Usage

==== Preferred - Docker

Build the Docker container with: 

[source,shell]
----
$ make docker-build
----

This can take a couple of minutes. Use the following command to run the script after the build has finished.
Make sure to set the LOG_DIR variable in the Makefile to the absulute path of the directory where you wish to store the script output.

[source,shell]
----
$ make docker-run
----

Adapte the variables in the Makefile to change the image name. The `-v` paramter that is defined for the docker-run command in the Makefile is used to redirect the result to your local host machine, such that the decryption results are not lost.  

IMPORTANT: Remember to adapt the conatiner path of the volume parameter if you configured a different directory for the log output!

==== Alternative

Python 3.6 is required for executing the script.
You also need to install the required dependencies. This can be done by running the following command in the project root: 
[source,shell]
----
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
----

If you encounter issues with the  installation of https://m2crypto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[M2Cryptio] refer to <<Error with M2Crypto Installation>>.

You can run the downloader script with the following command in the project root:
[source,shell]
----
$ python downloader.py
----

The script output will be written to the /logs directory.

==== Error with M2Crypto Installation
The installation of the M2Crypto package might cause installation problems. Refer to the pages below for help:
